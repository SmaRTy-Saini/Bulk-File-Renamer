## ðŸš€ Installation

Choose the version that best suits your workflow:

### Python Version (GUI)

1.  **Install Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2.  **Check Tkinter:** Tkinter is usually included with standard Python installations on Windows and macOS. On some Linux distributions, you might need to install it separately (e.g., `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python3-tk` on Debian/Ubuntu).
3.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/SmaRTy-Saini/Bulk-File-Renamer.git](https://github.com/SmaRTy-Saini/Bulk-File-Renamer.git)
    cd Bulk-File-Renamer
    ```
    Alternatively, download the repository files as a ZIP and extract them.
4.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python bulk-file-renamer.py
    ```

### PowerShell Version (CLI)

1.  **Open PowerShell:** Launch PowerShell on your Windows machine.
2.  **Get the Script:** Clone the repository (as shown above) or download `bulk_rename.ps1`.
3.  **Navigate to the script's directory:**
    ```powershell
    # Example: Replace 'path\to\Bulk-File-Renamer' with the actual path
    cd C:\path\to\Bulk-File-Renamer
    ```
4.  **Run the script:**
    ```powershell
    ./bulk_rename.ps1
    ```
    *Note: If you encounter an error about script execution being disabled, you may need to adjust your PowerShell execution policy. You can allow scripts for the current user by running:*
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
    ```
    *Run PowerShell as Administrator if needed for this command.*

## ðŸ›  Usage

### Python GUI

1.  Launch the application (`python bulk-file-renamer.py`).
